    "# Plan for the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we want to create a simple game that follows a time-traveling player. The first level of the game takes place in Ancient Egypt, where the player will be faced with four different NPCs--a rat guide, two different guards, and an evil cat. The rat guide narrates the objectives of the game as well as background info that will be used for the Ancient Egypt Quiz. The quiz will be given by another one of our NPCs, the Pyramid Guard. This guard, on collision, will prompt the player with a quiz about different facts about Ancient Egyptian culture. The player will have to submit their answers and will receive a score based on the accuracy of their answers. The Tomb Guard is the third NPC, and it gives a randomized greeting to the player on collision. There are four total greetings. Our last NPC is the Evil Cat, which chases the player around the screen. If the cat collides with the player, the game will end. The second level of the game will take place in Victorian England; it will have roughly the same mechanics--four NPCs, quizzes, something chasing the player, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we've already done\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a flowchart that describes the different aspects of the game as well as the different game functions and variables. We have added small functions such as checkProximityToPlayer, setTimeout, and shuffleAnswers, and many more to more customize our game. We've created custom NPCs and a custom game logo to personalize the game and make it unique to ourselves. Each NPC sprite sheet was completely hand-drawn by us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we have yet to do\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a more solidified objective for the game, such as adding functions that allow the player to lose or win. We want to add a proper storyline to the game, adding more to the RPG aspect of it. This includes adding dialogue given by the NPCs where the player chooses different dialogue options in response, allowing the game to feel more immersive. We also have yet to add the level for Victorian England."
