    "\n",
    "I thought Night at the Museum was an amazing experience because I got to look at more experienced games and codes. Additionally, we recieved very beneficial feedback from parents and other students. I believe this feedback will help ensure a successful and likeable game for my partner and I.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "As described by parents, classmates, and more advanced computer science students, they all loved our visuals and how cohesive the themes were. They also appreciated that they were handmade. We also have ambitious plans for the future of the game that we described to people at N@TM. They wanted to see our plans in action, such as the Tomb Level and the cat enemy. Some people reccomended a more cohesive quiz layout, which we were able to incorporate. Additionally, they wanted to see our Rat Guide working, which we also were able to add.\n",
