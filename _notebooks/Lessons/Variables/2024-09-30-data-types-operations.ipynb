    "### Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In game development, understanding the different data types in JavaScript is crucial for managing the various elements and attributes of your game. Primitive data types include numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null, symbols, and BigInts. Reference data types include objects, arrays, and functions. Each type plays a unique role in creating a dynamic and interactive gaming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number**:\n",
    "   - Represents numerical values, health and timeInMilliSeconds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String**:\n",
    "   - Represents text, such as the user's name or keypress.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Boolean**:\n",
    "   - Represents true/false values, such as isAlive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Undefined**:\n",
    "   - Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Null**:\n",
    "   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value, such as an empty inventory slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Symbol**:\n",
    "   - Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as unique identifiers for game objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **BigInt**:\n",
    "   - Represents very large integers, such as the total number of points accumulated over many games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object**:\n",
    "   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs, such as a player's attributes or game settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array**:\n",
    "   - Represents an ordered collection of values, such as a list of high scores or inventory items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function**:\n",
    "   - Represents a block of code designed to perform a specific task, such as attacking an enemy or saving the game."

    "### Data Type Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, we will be interacting with data and data types. Data types have operators that allow you to alter the data types.\n",

    "### Concatenation\n",
