The first pharaoh of Egypt was Narmer, who unified Upper and Lower Egypt around 3100 BCE. The Egyptians developed hieroglyphics, a complex writing system using pictorial symbols to record their history, religious beliefs, and government activities. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu, stands as a remarkable achievement of Egyptian engineering, primarily constructed from stone. The pyramids were built as tombs for pharaohs, ensuring their safe passage into the afterlife. The Sphinx, a majestic statue with a lion’s body and a human head, served as the guardian of the Giza Plateau. Egyptian religion played a significant role in daily life, with Osiris being the god of the afterlife and Cleopatra known for her beauty and political skill in leading Egypt. Another famous queen, Nefertiti, was admired for her powerful influence during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Pharaoh Tutankhamun, often called King Tut, is famous today because his tomb was discovered nearly intact in 1922, providing valuable insights into Egyptian burial practices. Ancient Egypt’s rich culture, monumental architecture, and powerful rulers continue to captivate the world today.";
